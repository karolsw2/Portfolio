				.intro__title About me
				p I've been programming since I was twelve, but I've been putting all my effort into it for the last two years. Every single day I'm learning how to create better and more sophisticated projects, and therefore I'm determined to improve and learn from my mistakes.

				.intro__title My workflow
				p A day without coding is a day lost (just look on my github's contribution graph). If I'm not coding that means that I'm probably studying or (sometimes) sleeping. In my spare time I also like to read books, though.
